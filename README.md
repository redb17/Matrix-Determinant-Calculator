# Matrix Determinant Calculator Web App.
#### Calculate determinant of matrices(of any order).
#### * There are many apps online which calculate the determinant but they are limited to size of matrices upto (100 x 100) or (1000 x 1000). These apps use mathematical methods like Laplace's formula, Sylvester's determinant theorem, Cramer's rule, etc.
#### * I have designed a recursive algorithm which can be used with matrix of any size.
#### * I have tested this algorithm for size = (10,000 x 10,000) on random numbers and it ran without any error and was executed in about 15 seconds(intel i5).
#### * My algorithm's code can be found in 'public/assets/js-ajax.js'. Also Java Source Code can be found on my github repo.

## How to use(in windows)?
#### * Download and install npm(node package manager).
#### * Open terminal and go to this project's directory.
#### * Type 'npm install'. This will install all the dependencies from 'package.json' file.
#### * Type 'node app.js' to start server on local port(most probably http://127.0.0.1:8080).
#### * Or go to 'https://redb17determinant.herokuapp.com/'.
